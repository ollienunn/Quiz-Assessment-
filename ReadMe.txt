The quiz is seperated into 3 categories 
There are rules:
No looking up the answers (its ok to get it wrong)
if you don't know guess better than leaving it blank
don't cheat just to get on the leaderboard
must use a proper name for the leaderboard
some questions have multiple answers for pronounciation or preference to say it, so answer how you prefer
most importantly have fun
